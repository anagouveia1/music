The files added to this repository represent a few of the singles I was able to produce through one of my YouTube episode videos. Ice Cream Bars was somewhat of a good tag to look up the video online. These audios show that more than anything the content produced is original and often with a sense of continuity. 

In a way, although my backing tracks were selected at random by YouTube, it seems that I'm in the very beginnings of developing my own style. In these tunes, it is clear to me that some of my greatest influences, guys like Led Zeppellin, Metallica, Heavy Metal Bands & Charlie Brown Jr. play a key role on the sounds I made live during these YouTube broadcast.

Certainly, there are parts that still require improvement and I hope I'm capable to transform these tunes into something worthwhile.
