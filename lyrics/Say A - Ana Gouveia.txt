Say A
Ana Gouveia

Feeling like I could just
cry alone in my bed
But sometimes I like to say
All these voices in my head
Are keeping me up at night
In and I still can't feel that vibe
Least the internet is top speed
I'm at 250 megabytes and I feel like my brain can't handle this
Say eh ah A
A
A
A
AA
AAA
AA

Hearing the universe
Feeling like this isn't the first time
It's my right I know this is my life

Why are you trying to stop what came from me?
It's my own thing, its my own dang, 
Saving me, helping me, letting be, 
E

E

A
A
A
I

I Still feel nothing
Though I just wanna cry
Did you hear me last night?

I = Ai

Twenty thousand years
And man cant satisfy his greed
I'm sorry I just regret dat

I read in a story book
But I couldn't hope dat
De future is Ted.
